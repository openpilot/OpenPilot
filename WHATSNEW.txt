--- RELEASE-13.06 ---

This is the first official OpenPilot Revolution software release. This version
also supports the CopterControl, CC3D, OPLinkMini and the upcoming OP OSD.
There a number of significant backend changes in this version compared to
previous software releases: from new toolchains and build system to a source
code reformatting that is inline with our project style guidelines.

The goal of this release is to provide CC3D-style features for the new
Revolution platform (using the Revo's internal modem and external OPLinkMini
board). Advanced features such as Altitude Hold, Position Hold, Guidance,
Return to Home, and AutoLanding are still in development and will be available
in future releases. The availability of those features will depend on how many
people are able to contribute with code, testing and documentation.

Remember that the first Revo hardware batch was intended for developers/
bleeding-edge testers, not end users who want a 100% final platform.

- New bootloaders are REQUIRED for this release to support new features such
  as erase settings and others. As always, bootloaders can be updated without
  any special programmer hardware using the bootloader updater firmware files.
- F1 boards (CC, CC3D, OPLinkMini) require bootloader version 4 or higher.
- F4 boards (Revolution, OSD prototype) require bootloader version 5 or higher.
- Check the wiki for details of how to update them:
  http://wiki.openpilot.org/display/BUILDS/Bootloader+update

Please remember to take a moment to view these important tutorials:

What's New / Release Notes
--------------------------

NEW:

- Firmware folders removed.
  The firmware files folder has been removed in this release. These files
  are now integrated into the GCS so they are always up to date and there is
  less risk of a firmware mismatch. To update your firmware you must use
  either Vehicle Setup Wizard (big green button at the top right on the
  Welcome GCS tab) or the new Auto-Update button on the GCS Firmware tab.

- Responsiveness sliders.
  To simplify tuning, we have introduced a new Responsiveness slider that
  will allow you to modify stick response. For best results, you should
  still tune your system with PIDs as tight as possible for better
  stabilisation. This will result in better stabilisation, and at the
  same time soft or sharp response according to your preferences.

- Auto-Update firmware.
  This feature simplifies all OpenPilot board firmware updates. Now all
  you have to do is click "Auto-update" on the Firmware tab and follow the
  instructions to reflash your OpenPilot board. This is essentially the
  same as Rescue but uses the embedded firmware images so there is no need
  to browse for them anymore.

- Erase Settings Option.
  We previously had a hacky way to delete bad or incompatible settings from
  our OpenPilot boards. This old special firmware that did this is now
  deprecated and the functionality is now integrated into the latest
  bootloaders and firmwares.

  To erase settings enter DFU (boot) mode (using Halt or Rescue function)
  and click the "Erase settings" button on the Firmware tab and follow the
  instructions. This will NOT work with an older bootloader and the "Erase
  settings" button will be disabled if an out of date bootloader is detected.

- Language defaults.
  GCS now uses the system default language (only French and English are
  available currently, please contribute translations). You can change the
  language in the GCS Options at any time.

- CDC driver install option (Windows only).
  This is an optional USB virtual serial port that is useful, for example,
  for updating your GPS configuration using the U-Blox u-Center software.
  It is NOT required for normal configuration of OpenPilot boards. If it is
  not installed, virtual serial port features will not be available. This
  driver is not signed by Microsoft, but in fact it uses serial port drivers
  from Windows and only the driver information INF file is supplied by
  OpenPilot.

- Lots of help tooltips were added to the GCS. Hovering your mouse over an
  option in the GCS will show them, please review for help during tuning/
  setting up.

- A large amount of general improvements, code clean ups and minor bugs
  resolved.

KNOWN ISSUES:

- On Linux you should remove the OpenPilot package if it was previously
  installed, then install this new one. This is a known issue and likely
  be fixed later.

- Due to changes in USB descriptors to support new features, USB drivers
  on Windows must be updated. If after using Rescue or Wizard or Auto-Update
  button the GCS cannot connect to the board, you may be experiencing this
  USB issue. To resolve it you should remove the old drivers (ones with
  yellow exclamation mark) and allow Windows to find them again.

  Here is how to do it:

  Windows XP:
   - Right click on "My Computer" on your desktop and select "Properties".
   - Select the "Hardware" tab.
   - Select the "Device Manager".
   - Scroll down the list until you see the "Universal Serial Bus Controllers"
     selection.
   - Click it to expand the list of USB drivers. Right-click on the driver(s)
     you wish to uninstall and select "Uninstall".

  Windows 7/Vista:
   - Right click on "My Computer" on your desktop and select "Properties".
   - Select "Device Manager" in the upper left-hand corner of the window.
   - Scroll down the list until you see the "Universal Serial Bus Controllers"
     selection.
   - Click it to expand the list of USB drivers. Right-click on the driver(s)
     you wish to uninstall and select "Uninstall".

  Then disconnect the board from USB, wait few seconds and re-connect it to
  your computer. Windows should find new drivers and install them properly.

- If GCS crashes when switching to the Flight Data tab, it usually means
  your PC needs newer video drivers. That tab contains a ModelView widget
  which uses OpenGL. It is known to crash on some graphics cards with old
  and buggy drivers.

- Sensor calibration is not final. It will be reworked completely to
  increase its accuracy and make it easier to use.

- Until the calibration is reworked, default attitude estimation algorithm
  used by Revo is a complimentary filter with magnetometers disabled. Hence
  Revo does not use them yet to correct yaw drift. Magnetometers can be
  enabled, but you should properly calibrate them first. That's the reason
  why they are disabled by default.

- AltitudeHold/Vario modes are enabled but not officially supported. Do
  not expect it to work perfectly and be considered production quality.
  You may play with it and report your issues and suggestions at your own
  risk. If you are not using a case for your Revo, we strongly recommend
  covering the barometer sensor with some foam to shield the sensor from
  wind and light.

- Note that throttle stick in AltitudeVario mode is used to control vertical
  velocity, sometimes called vario altitude in other platforms, centre stick
  means hold altitude and there is a dead band around centre stick.

- There are currently no configuration options for the Radio module in
  the Revolution except for Radio enable/disable and output power. This is
  intentional because all configuration should be done using its paired
  ground OPLink coordinator.

  How to configure the Revolution to OPLinkMini radio link:

  - Make sure you have the newest bootloaders and matching firmwares
    between the Revolution, GCS and OPLink.
  - Enable the radio in the Revolution, click save and disconnect the board
    from USB.
  - Power it from external supply to continue.
  - Then connect the OPLink board to USB and scroll down in the GCS config
    widget to find OPLink icon at the end of list. This icon is only
    available when an OPLink is detected.
  - To pair the two radios, select the Revolution side radio address in the
    list of found boards, select it, click Add to add to the list of paired
    radios and click Save. After unplugging the board from the USB and
    plugging back your OPLink it should show "Connected", and you can
    continue with the configuration.

- Do not set the Revolution modem or OPLinkMini output power to high values
  without antenna connected, this can damage the hardware.

2012-11-12
Implemented smoothing filter for accelerometer data.
Added support for Mode 3 and Mode 4 to the TX Configuration Wizard.

--- RELEASE-12.10.1 ---

2012-10-26
Temporary disabled AutoTune GCS GUI. It was listed as an experimental
feature in the previous release, there were however a few cases where
it did not behave as expected.

--- RELEASE-12.10 ---

2012-10-06
Receiver port can now be configured as PPM *and* PWM inputs.
Pin 1 is PPM, other pins are PWM inputs.

2012-07-27
Added the ability to load stylesheets from external file according to operating system:
macos.qss, linux.qss, windows.qss
Files should be placed inside the app folder.

2012-07-27
Several UI changes. 
MixerCurveWidget refactoring, now as a simple and advanced view.

2012-07-27
Added "advanced mode" option to general settings. Right now it only shows the hidden apply buttons.
To enable go to tools->options->General and click one of the checkboxes to give focus to the form,
then press F7

2012-07-27
Made the flight mode switch and accessory pots move according to user input on the input wizard.

2012-07-27
Changed the board pictures on the uploader widget

2012-07-27
Add more verbose debug output on the UAVOBJECTS saving code.

2012-08-11
CopterControl can now emulate an 8-channel USB HID joystick.  Primarily,
this lets you use any RC transmitter with flight simulators on your PC.

2012-07-20
AeroSimRC simulator plugin is now included into the Windows distribution
(will be installed into .../OpenPilot/misc/AeroSIM-RC directory).  Still
being an experimental development tool, it could be used to play with
HITL version 2.  Other platforms include udp_test utility which can be
used to check the connectivity with AeroSimRC plugin running on Windows
machine.

2012-07-10
On Windows the installation mode was changed from per-user to per-machine
(for all users) installation.  It is recommended to completely uninstall
previous version before installing new one to remove per-user installed
files.  Per-machine installation requires elevated (administrator) previleges
during install.  But since the same rights are now required to install
optional CDC driver (virtual communication port), it was deemed acceptable.

2012-06-04
AeroSimRC support merged into next

2012-05-26
VirtualFlybar which allows a more aggressive flight mode than rate mode
support.  Also PiroCompensation added.

2012-05-26
Revert some UI changes that didn't work consistently between OSX and Windows.

2012-05-24
Merged the updated firmware for the PipXtreme, thanks to Brian for a lot of
work on this.

2012-05-04
Support for CC3D.  This involved changes to various things such as the sensors
being split from AttitudeRaw to Accels,Gyros,Magnetometer.  A single firmware
image fw_coptercontrol will run on both CC and CC3D.  When compiling the
bootloader one must set the HW_REVISION to the appropriate value.  0x01 is for
CC and 0x02 is for CC3D.  If the wrong bootloader is installed the firmware
will not run.

2012-05-02
Reduction in the memory usage due to the UAVObject metadata.  Now the update
periods are using a smaller data type and the various flags relating to access
controls and update modes are stored in a bitfield.  The UAVObjectBrowser has
not been updated to allow these modes to be easily changed.

2012-03-31
Support for ground vehicle configuration has been added to the the GCS.

2012-02-14
New QML based system to allow more flexible UI.  Upgraded stabilization
configuration.

2012-01-02
CC FW now supports USB Virtual Com Port (VCP/CDC) in addition to the original HID interface
New ComUsbBridge module can bridge any serial port to the USB CDC port
CC FW now detects repeated faults during init and boots with default hwsettings

2012-01-02
Added new camera stabilization features: AxisLock mode and LPF.

2011-12-10
Merged a change that sorts the UAVO fields based on size.  Because this changes
all of the objects, erase all existing flash files based on this.

2011-11-04
New Spektrum/JR satellite receiver driver implementation.
It now provides explicit selection of DSM2 (and DSMJ), DSMX (10bit) and
DSMX (11bit) serial protocol variations to better serve different frame
and resolution modes. The protocol name used now is DSM instead of
previously used Spektrum to make it less ambiguous when used with JR
2.4GHz radios.

2011-10-20
Inputs can be remapped to outputs to allow up to 10 channels of control.  The
receiver inputs remap as follows:
Receiver 3 because output channel 7
Receiver 4 because output channel 8
Receiver 5 because output channel 9
Receiver 6 because output channel 10

2011-10-11
Fix for the Mac telemetry rates and specifically how long enumeration took.

2011-10-08
Make the flash chip need to be have bad magic for a full second before erasing
settings.  Should avoid random lost settings.

Max rate now ONLY applies to attitude and axis lock mode.  Manual rate is the
only term that limits the rate mode now (and in axis lock when you push stick
only manual rate applies).  Also integrals are reset when unused.

Some large updates to the input system.  Now multiple receivers can be
connected at once.  A wizard was added for configuring the input channels.  A
specific collective pitch channel was added.

Improvements to the failsafe handling code for inputs.  PWM power off is now
detected properly.  Powering on transmitter for Spektrum Satellite no longer
causes a glitch on servos.

Added Camera Stabilization and a gui to configure this.  This is a software
selectable module from the GUI.  However, a restart is required to make it
active.  The GUI does not currently expose the configuration for using the
transmitter to change the view angle but this is supported by the hardware.

By default a lot of diagnostic objects that were enabled by default are now
disabled in the build.  This include TaskInfo (and all the FreeRTOS options
that provide that debugging information).  Also MixerStatus, I2CStatus,
WatchdogStatus and RateDesired.  These can be reenabled for debugging with
-DDIAG_ALL.

Fixed packaging aesthetic issues.  Also avoid runtime issues on OSX Lion by
disabling the ModelView and Notify plugins for now (sorry).

Added support for PPM receivers from James W. Now all 4 interfaces (R/C
standard PWM, combined PPM (MK), Spektrum satellite, Futaba S.Bus) are
supported and configurable through the GCS hardware configuration tab.

Updated module initialization from Mathieu which separates the initialization
from the task startup.  Also implements a method to reclaim unused ram from
initialization and end of memory for the FreeRTOS heap.

Improvements to the stabilization code.  Included a LPF on the gyros to smooth
out noise in high vibration environments.  Also two new modes: axis-lock and
weak leveling.  Axis-lock will try and hold an axis at a fixed position and
reject any disturbances.  This is like heading-hold on a heli for the tail but
can be useful for other axes.  Weak leveling is rate mode with a weak
correction to self level the craft - good for easier rate mode flying.

2011-07-07
Dynamic hardware configuration from Stac.  The input type is now
selected from ManualControlSettings.InputMode and the aircraft must be rebooted
after changing this.  Also for CopterControl the HwSettings object must
indicate which modules are connected to which ports.  PPM currently not
working.
