--- RELEASE-13.06 --- Italian Stallion Release ---

This is the first Revolution software release which also supports CC, CC3D, OPLinkMini and
unreleased yet OP OSD boards. This is a major change: from different toolchains and build
system to the whole source code reformatting according to project style guidelines. The goal
of this release is to provide CC-style features for new Revo platform + radio using Revo's
internal modem and external OPLinkMini board. All advanced features like Altitude Hold,
Position Hold, Guidance, Return to Home, AutoLanding etc. are not released yet and planned
for following releases.

Important Release Notes:

- Since this release the packaged distribution does not contain firmware files in a folder.
  They are now integrated into the GCS so always are up to date. To update you must use
  either Vehicle Setup Wizard (big green button on the Welcome GCS tab) or new Auto-Update
  button on the Firmware tab.

- New Auto-Update feature simplifies all OpenPilot board firmware updates. Just click it
  and follow on-screen directions to reflash your board (CC, CC3D, OPLinkMini, Revolution
  or OSD prototypes). Internally it is the same as Rescue but uses embedded firmware images,
  no need to browse for them anymore.

- New bootloaders are REQUIRED for this release to support some of new features like settings
  erase and some others. As always, bootloaders can be updated without any special programmer
  hardware using bootloader updaters firmware. Currently F1 boards (CC, CC3D, OPLinkMini)
  require bootloader version 4 or higher, and F4 boards (Revolution, OSD prototype) require
  bootloader version 5 or higher. Check the wiki for details of how to update them:
  http://wiki.openpilot.org/display/BUILDS/Bootloader+update

- New feature: settings erase option. In the past some special settings erase firmware was
  used to erase bad or incompatible settings from CC/CC3D boards. Now it is deprecated, and
  this functionality is now integrated into bootloader and firmware. To erase any board
  settings you must have latest bootloader. Then enter DFU (boot) mode (using Halt or Rescue
  function) and click "Erase settings" button on the Firmware tab and follow on-screen
  instructions. This will NOT work with older bootloader, and the button will be disabled.

- On Linux you should remove OpenPilot package if was installed, then install new one. This
  is a known issue and likely be fixed later.

- On Windows there is a CDC driver installer option. This is an optional USB virtual serial
  port useful, for example, for updating your GPS configuration using U-Blox u-Center software.
  But it is NOT required to configure boards. If not installed, virtual serial port features
  will not be available. This driver is not signed by Microsoft, but in fact it uses serial
  port drivers from Windows and only driver information INF file is supplied by the OpenPilot.
  Hence it is safe to install.

- Due to changes in USB descriptors to support new features, USB drivers on Windows must be
  updated. If after Rescue or Wizard or Auto-Update button the GCS cannot connect to the board,
  it may be due to this issue. To resolve you should remove old drivers (ones with yellow
  exclamation mark) and allow Windows to find them again. Here is how:

  Windows XP:
  - click on the desktop "My Computer" icon and select "Properties";
  - select the "Hardware" tab by clicking on it once;
  - select the "Device Manager" tab by clicking on it;
  - scroll down the list until you see the "Universal Serial Bus Controllers" selection.
    Click it to expand the list of USB drivers. Right-click on the driver(s) you wish to
    uninstall and select the "Uninstall" function. The driver will be uninstalled.

  Windows 7/Vista:
  - on the desktop right-click the "Computer" icon and select "Properties";
  - select "Device Manager" in the upper left-hand corner of the window;
  - scroll down the list until you see the "Universal Serial Bus Controllers" selection.
    Click it once to expand the list of USB drivers. Right-click on the driver(s) you wish
    to uninstall and select the "Uninstall" function. The driver will be uninstalled.

  Then disconnect the board from USB, wait few seconds and connect it back. Windows should find new
  drivers and install them properly.

- GCS now uses system default language (only French and English are available yet, please
  contribute). You can choose language using GCS Options dialog if you have existing GCS
  configuaration.

- This release provides only CC3D-class features + radio. For example, it does NOT use
  magnetometers to correct yaw and uses simple complimentary filter for attitude estimation.
  So you should expect from it only CC3D-like performance. More advanced features will be
  enabled step by step in the following releases with some help from new contributors,
  we hope. Remember that the first Revo hardware batch was inended for developers, not
  end users.

- Lots of help tooltips were added to the GCS. Try watching them when tuning.

- If GCS crashes when switching to the Flight data tab, it usually means your PC needs newer
  video drivers. That tab contains ModelView widget which uses OpenGL. It is known to crash
  in some cases.

- Sensor calibration is not final. It will be reworked completely to increase its accuracy
  and make it easier to use.

- AltitudeHold mode is enabled, but it is not officially released. Do not expect it to be of
  production quality. But you may play with it and report your issues and suggestions. It is
  recommended to use some foam to protect baro sensor from wind and light. Also note that
  throttle stick in AltitudeHold mode is used to control vertical velocity.

- Tuning your system please set PIDs as tight as possible for better stabilisation. To soften
  the stick response if necessary use new Responsiveness options. This will result in better
  stabilisation, and at the same time soft or sharp response according to your preferences.

- There is no configuration options for Radio module in the Revo config except for Radio
  enable/disable and output power. This is intentional because all configuration should be
  done using its paired ground OPLink coordinator. Enable radio in the Revo, save and
  disconnect Revo from USB. Power it from external supply to continue. Then connect OPLink
  board to USB and scroll down the GCS config widget to find OPLink icon in the end of list.
  This icon is only available when OPLink is connected and recognised, this also requires new
  bootloader and matching to Revo and GCS firmware on the OPLink board. To pair select the Revo
  side Radio address in the list of found boards, select it, click Add to add to the list of
  paired radios and click Save. After USB unplugging and plugging back your OPLink should show
  "Connected", and you can continue with configuration.

Here is a list of some known unresolved issues. If an issue has JIRA ID [OP-XXX],
you may track it using the following URL: http://bugs.openpilot.org/browse/OP-XXX

+ Only French translation is updated, use English for other locales or help with translations.
+ Radio Wizard confused by a reversed throttle, fix it on your transmitter before starting wizard.
+ Radio Wizard Throttle display does not show full range properly.
+ [Windows 8] USB Driver is broken.
+ Firmware Update Instructions on Firmware Tab not entirely accurate for all upgrade paths.
+ Tricopter's using Vehicle Wizard need to check servo does not need reversed manually.
+ XAircraft ESCs uses non-standard PPM range which may cause issues with Vehicle Wizard.
+ Spectrum Satellite Receivers setup in Radio Wizard may have wrong protocol set.
+ Old Intel 965 have an OpenGL bug that turns the QML PFD black and while.
+ [OP-732] Import UAV Settings for inactive modules crashes the running firmware (board restarts).
           Workaround: update firmware, power cycle, enable modules, power cycle, import configuration.
+ [OP-747] Board infinitely reboots itself after firmware upgrade (settings erase firmware is a workaround).
+ [OP-723] GCS uses the system language ot the 1st run. After restart it uses English (can be changed later).
+ [OP-725] GCS camera stab config error message disappears too fast (but config error is cleared as it should)
+ [OP-767] GCS does not send AttitudeActual packets over serial port when GPS is connected and system is armed
+ [OP-768] GCS does not show UAV position on the map (master or next CC branches, but works in Revo branches)
+ [OP-769] Can't enter "12,45" on German system. Workaround: change GCS language (in fact, locale) to German.

2012-11-12
Implemented smoothing filter for accelerometer data.
Added support for Mode 3 and Mode 4 to the TX Configuration Wizard.

--- RELEASE-12.10.1 ---

2012-10-26
Temporary disabled AutoTune GCS GUI. It was listed as an experimental
feature in the previous release, there were however a few cases where
it did not behave as expected.

--- RELEASE-12.10 ---

2012-10-06
Receiver port can now be configured as PPM *and* PWM inputs.
Pin 1 is PPM, other pins are PWM inputs.

2012-07-27
Added the ability to load stylesheets from external file according to operating system:
macos.qss, linux.qss, windows.qss
Files should be placed inside the app folder.

2012-07-27
Several UI changes. 
MixerCurveWidget refactoring, now as a simple and advanced view.

2012-07-27
Added "advanced mode" option to general settings. Right now it only shows the hidden apply buttons.
To enable go to tools->options->General and click one of the checkboxes to give focus to the form,
then press F7

2012-07-27
Made the flight mode switch and accessory pots move according to user input on the input wizard.

2012-07-27
Changed the board pictures on the uploader widget

2012-07-27
Add more verbose debug output on the UAVOBJECTS saving code.

2012-08-11
CopterControl can now emulate an 8-channel USB HID joystick.  Primarily,
this lets you use any RC transmitter with flight simulators on your PC.

2012-07-20
AeroSimRC simulator plugin is now included into the Windows distribution
(will be installed into .../OpenPilot/misc/AeroSIM-RC directory).  Still
being an experimental development tool, it could be used to play with
HITL version 2.  Other platforms include udp_test utility which can be
used to check the connectivity with AeroSimRC plugin running on Windows
machine.

2012-07-10
On Windows the installation mode was changed from per-user to per-machine
(for all users) installation.  It is recommended to completely uninstall
previous version before installing new one to remove per-user installed
files.  Per-machine installation requires elevated (administrator) previleges
during install.  But since the same rights are now required to install
optional CDC driver (virtual communication port), it was deemed acceptable.

2012-06-04
AeroSimRC support merged into next

2012-05-26
VirtualFlybar which allows a more aggressive flight mode than rate mode
support.  Also PiroCompensation added.

2012-05-26
Revert some UI changes that didn't work consistently between OSX and Windows.

2012-05-24
Merged the updated firmware for the PipXtreme, thanks to Brian for a lot of
work on this.

2012-05-04
Support for CC3D.  This involved changes to various things such as the sensors
being split from AttitudeRaw to Accels,Gyros,Magnetometer.  A single firmware
image fw_coptercontrol will run on both CC and CC3D.  When compiling the
bootloader one must set the HW_REVISION to the appropriate value.  0x01 is for
CC and 0x02 is for CC3D.  If the wrong bootloader is installed the firmware
will not run.

2012-05-02
Reduction in the memory usage due to the UAVObject metadata.  Now the update
periods are using a smaller data type and the various flags relating to access
controls and update modes are stored in a bitfield.  The UAVObjectBrowser has
not been updated to allow these modes to be easily changed.

2012-03-31
Support for ground vehicle configuration has been added to the the GCS.

2012-02-14
New QML based system to allow more flexible UI.  Upgraded stabilization
configuration.

2012-01-02
CC FW now supports USB Virtual Com Port (VCP/CDC) in addition to the original HID interface
New ComUsbBridge module can bridge any serial port to the USB CDC port
CC FW now detects repeated faults during init and boots with default hwsettings

2012-01-02
Added new camera stabilization features: AxisLock mode and LPF.

2011-12-10
Merged a change that sorts the UAVO fields based on size.  Because this changes
all of the objects, erase all existing flash files based on this.

2011-11-04
New Spektrum/JR satellite receiver driver implementation.
It now provides explicit selection of DSM2 (and DSMJ), DSMX (10bit) and
DSMX (11bit) serial protocol variations to better serve different frame
and resolution modes. The protocol name used now is DSM instead of
previously used Spektrum to make it less ambiguous when used with JR
2.4GHz radios.

2011-10-20
Inputs can be remapped to outputs to allow up to 10 channels of control.  The
receiver inputs remap as follows:
Receiver 3 because output channel 7
Receiver 4 because output channel 8
Receiver 5 because output channel 9
Receiver 6 because output channel 10

2011-10-11
Fix for the Mac telemetry rates and specifically how long enumeration took.

2011-10-08
Make the flash chip need to be have bad magic for a full second before erasing
settings.  Should avoid random lost settings.

2011-09-12
Max rate now ONLY applies to attitude and axis lock mode.  Manual rate is the
only term that limits the rate mode now (and in axis lock when you push stick
only manual rate applies).  Also integrals are reset when unused.

2011-09-09
Some large updates to the input system.  Now multiple receivers can be
connected at once.  A wizard was added for configuring the input channels.  A
specific collective pitch channel was added.

2011-09-04
Improvements to the failsafe handling code for inputs.  PWM power off is now
detected properly.  Powering on transmitter for Spektrum Satellite no longer
causes a glitch on servos.

2011-08-10
Added Camera Stabilization and a gui to configure this.  This is a software
selectable module from the GUI.  However, a restart is required to make it
active.  The GUI does not currently expose the configuration for using the
transmitter to change the view angle but this is supported by the hardware.

2011-08-10
By default a lot of diagnostic objects that were enabled by default are now
disabled in the build.  This include TaskInfo (and all the FreeRTOS options
that provide that debugging information).  Also MixerStatus, I2CStatus,
WatchdogStatus and RateDesired.  These can be reenabled for debugging with
-DDIAG_ALL.

2011-08-04
Fixed packaging aesthetic issues.  Also avoid runtime issues on OSX Lion by
disabling the ModelView and Notify plugins for now (sorry).

2011-07-29
Added support for PPM receivers from James W. Now all 4 interfaces (R/C
standard PWM, combined PPM (MK), Spektrum satellite, Futaba S.Bus) are
supported and configurable through the GCS hardware configuration tab.

2011-07-17
Updated module initialization from Mathieu which separates the initialization
from the task startup.  Also implements a method to reclaim unused ram from
initialization and end of memory for the FreeRTOS heap.

2011-07-12
Improvements to the stabilization code.  Included a LPF on the gyros to smooth
out noise in high vibration environments.  Also two new modes: axis-lock and
weak leveling.  Axis-lock will try and hold an axis at a fixed position and
reject any disturbances.  This is like heading-hold on a heli for the tail but
can be useful for other axes.  Weak leveling is rate mode with a weak
correction to self level the craft - good for easier rate mode flying.

2011-07-07
Dynamic hardware configuration from Stac.  The input type is now
selected from ManualControlSettings.InputMode and the aircraft must be rebooted
after changing this.  Also for CopterControl the HwSettings object must
indicate which modules are connected to which ports.  PPM currently not
working.
